2. Load the Training Dataset.

The Google training data has information from 3 Jan 2012 to 30 Dec 2016. There are five columns. The Open column tells the price at which a stock started trading when the market opened on a particular day. The Close column refers to the price of an individual stock when the stock exchange closed the market for the day. The High column depicts the highest price at which a stock traded during a period. The Low column tells the lowest price of the period. Volume is the total amount of trading activity during a period of time.
